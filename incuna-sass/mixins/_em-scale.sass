// Mixin to define a font size scale to allow easier use of ems

// Allows for as many different breakpoints and font sizes as needed
// $font-base is required, also at least one breakpoint and 
// font-size change must be added for the mixin to work

// The mixin is designed mobile first, so $font-base should be your
// mobile font size and $breakpoints-map should start with your 
// smallest breakpoint and first font-size change, then continue in 
// sequence from there

// $breakpoints-map should be structured as $breakpoint: $font-size

// Example usage:

// .thing
//     @include em-scale(14px, ('screen and (min-width: 768px)': 16px, 
//          'screen and (min-width: 1025px)': 20px))
//     padding: 1em

// the above will create an element with padding that scales to match the
// font size the font size will change at 2 different breakpoints, first
// going from 14px to 16px when the screan is 768px wide, and then increasing
// to 20px at a screen width of 1025px. The padding will scale similarly
// starting at 14px, then increasing to 16px at the first breakpoint and 20px
// at the second

// You can also use variables to reference media query variables in your
// project:
//     @include em-scale(14px, ($px768: 16px, $px1025: 20px))
// or
//     @include em-scale(14px, ($tablet: 16px, $desktop: 20px))

@mixin em-scale($font-base, $breakpoints-map)
    font:
        size: $font-base
    @each $breakpoint, $font-size in $breakpoints-map
        @include media($breakpoint)
            font:
                size: $font-size
