// Mixin to define a font size scale to allow easier use of ems

// Allows for as many different breakpoints and font sizes as needed
// Only $font-base is required, mixin can be used without any 
// $breakpoint-sizes-list arguments, but at least one breakpoint and 
// font-size change should be added to make the mixin worth using

// The mixin is designed mobile first, so $font-base should be your
// mobile font size and $breakpoint-sizes-list should start with your 
// smallest breakpoint and first font-size change, then continue in 
// sequence from there

// Example usage:

// .thing
//     @include em-scale(14px, (('screen and (min-width: 768px)', 16px), 
//          ('screen and (min-width: 1025px)', 20px)))
//     padding: 1em

// the above will create an element with padding that scales to match the
// font size the font size will change at 2 different breakpoints, first
// going from 14px to 16px when the screan is 768px wide, and then increasing
// to 20px at a screen width of 1025px. The padding will scale similarly
// starting at 14px, then increasing to 16px at the first breakpoint and 20px
// at the second

// You can also use variables to reference media query variables in your
// project:
//     @include em-scale(14px, (($px768, 16px), ($px1025, 20px)))
// or
//     @include em-scale(14px, (($tablet, 16px), ($desktop, 20px)))

@mixin em-scale($font-base, $breakpoints-sizes-list: ())
    font:
        size: $font-base
    @each $change in $breakpoints-sizes-list
        @include media(#{nth($change, 1)})
            font:
                size: nth($change, 2)
